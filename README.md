# D3_javascript

Scripts for D3.js (Data Driven Documents) to present scientific data online. Based on the book [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/interactive-data-visualization/9781449340223/)
 
### Connect data to server (from csv and from variable)
- script 01
- data types of csv files have to be specified, otherwise it is recognized as string (no automatical recognition of numerical data)

### Bar chart via "div" and css via modified rectangles
- script 02
- strange way to plot something, because I basically create just different sized rectangles in a "division" ("div")

### SVG files
- script 03 importing svg files
- script 04 building svg files
- consist of creating an environment and adding objects to it
- if objects don't exist yet, just refer to them, add them with enter() and modify them afterward
